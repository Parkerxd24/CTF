The goal is simple: Win.

Attacking the event infrastructure or other teams is strictly prohibited.

This is a learning-focused, ethical hacking environment—let’s keep it that way.

Collaboration within teams is encouraged—but sharing solutions across teams is not allowed.

Submit flags exactly as you find them—case-sensitive, no spaces.

The scoreboard updates in real-time based on correct submissions.

4. No Cheating
Brute-forcing, flag-sharing between teams, or using solutions from other CTFs is not allowed.

All code, write-ups, and solutions must be your own.

Harassment, discrimination, or disruptive behavior will result in disqualification.

                       Instructions!

1. The first file will be an encrypted word, the word is 8 letters. Instructions below on how to decrypt it.

This will be one of the hardest points in this contest, this will take a while.
To decrypt this you will need to go through every line and find the word. It has 8 letters. Goodluck! (AI Not ALLOWED)
The word starts with S.

Once you get through decrypting all of that, you need to put the numbers with NO hyphens into the box and go to the file link provided.
Once doing that you will be instructed to find the password for the folder in the file link.

To get the password for the file link, you must break down the riddle and find the number, once you found the number
you must find the txt file with the list of 200 passwords and you have to count until you get to the number.
use that password into the file folder, and follow the instuctions in there.
