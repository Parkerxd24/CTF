I am a number with stories to tell,
I’m greater than a dozen times eight, as well.
Divide me by four, you’ll see a score,
A number revered in ancient lore.

Add me to the digits that sum in my name,
And subtract twice the square of a prime to tame.

My neighbors are even, my halves are neat,
I sit on a century’s extended seat.

I’m two digits beside the fabled hundred’s core —
Now tell me plainly: what number am I, for sure?
